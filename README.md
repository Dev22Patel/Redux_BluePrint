# E-commerce Redux Practice Project

Welcome to the E-commerce project built to practice and revisit Redux concepts! This project showcases a simplified online store with product listing and navigation features, created for educational purposes and hands-on learning of Redux integration within a React application.

## Project Overview

This e-commerce application demonstrates how to manage state efficiently in a React application using Redux. It includes the following core functionalities:

- **Product Listing Page**: Displays a catalog of products.
- **Navigation**: Enables seamless switching between different parts of the application.
- **State Management with Redux**: Utilizes Redux to manage and share state across components.
- **Custom Components**: Built with reusable components for better scalability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Deployment**: Hosted on [Vercel](https://ecommerce-indol-nine.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Product Display**: Shows a list of products with details.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Supports routing between the product pages and other views.
- **Global State Management**: Implements Redux for handling state related to the product list and user interactions.
- **Custom Components**: Components built to showcase React's component-based architecture.

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of personal practice to reinforce understanding of:

- Connecting React components to the Redux store.
- Creating reducers, actions, and using the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks.
- Implementing Redux for state management in a real-world scenario.
